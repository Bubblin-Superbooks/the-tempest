<h4>I.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p> 1 Scene I. 
On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning heard.
Enter <em>a Ship-Master</em> and <em>a Boatswain</em>. 
<em>Mast.</em> Boatswain!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Boats.</em> Here, master: what cheer?</p>
<p><em>Mast.</em> Good, speak to the mariners: fall to’t, yarely, or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir. Exit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enter <em>Mariners</em>.
<em>Boats.</em> Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the master’s whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,, if room enough!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Ferdinand, Gonzalo, and others.
<em>Alon.</em> Good boatswain, have care. Where’s the master? Play the men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Boats.</em> I pray now, keep below.</p>
<p><em>Ant.</em> Where is the master, boatswain,?</p>
<p><em>Boats.</em> Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your cabins: you do assist the storm.</p>
<p><em>Gon.</em> Nay, good, be patient.</p>
<p><em>Boats.</em> When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.</p>
<p><em>Gon.</em> Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.</p>
<p><em>Boats.</em> None that I more love than myself. You are a 20 Counsellor; if you can command these elements to silence, and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good I. 1. 25 hearts! Out of our way, I say. Exit.</p>
<p><em>Gon.</em> I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth 30 little advantage. If he be not born to be hanged, our case is miserable. Exeunt.,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Re-enter <em>Boatswain</em>.
<em>Boats.</em>  Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring her to try with main-course. [_A cry within._] [A plague upon this howling! they are louder than the weather 35 or our office.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Re-enter Sebastian, Antonio, and Gonzalo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o’er, and drown? Have you a mind to sink?</p>
<p><em>Seb.</em> A pox o’ your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!</p>
<p><em>Boats.</em> Work you, then.</p>
<p><em>Ant.</em> Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noise-maker. We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.</p>
<p><em>Gon.</em> I’ll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell, and as leaky as an unstanched 45 wench.</p>
<p><em>Boats.</em> Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to sea again; lay her off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enter <em>Mariners</em> wet.,
<em>Mariners.</em> All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Boats.</em> What, must our mouths be cold?</p>
<hr>
<h4>I.</h4>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>50 <em>Gon.</em>  The king and prince [at prayers! let’s assist them,</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>For our case is as theirs.</p>
<p><em>Seb.</em></p>
<p>I’m out of patience.</p>
<p><em>Ant.</em> We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:</p>
<p>This wide-chapp’d rascal,—would thou mightst lie drowning</p>
<p>The washing of ten tides!</p>
<p><em>Gon.</em></p>
<p>He’ll be hang’d yet,</p>
<p>Though every drop of water swear against it,</p>
<p>And gape at widest to glut him.</p>
<h5>A confused noise within : <em>“Mercy on us!”—“We split, we split!”—“Farewell my wife and children!”—[“Farewell, brother!”,—“We split, we split, we split!”</em></h5>
<p><em>Ant.</em> Let’s all sink with the king.</p>
<p><em>Seb.</em> Let’s take leave of him. Exeunt Ant. and Seb.,</p>
<p><em>Gon.</em> Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze , any thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain die a 65 dry death. [Exeunt.,</p>

<p> 2 Scene II. <em>The island. Before Prospero’s cell.</em>
Enter Prospero and Miranda.

<p>Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.</p>
<p>The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,</p>
<p>But that the sea, mounting to the welkin’s cheek,,</p>
<p>Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffer’d</p>
<p>With those that I saw suffer! a brave vessel,</p>
<p>Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,</p>
<p>Dash’d all to pieces. O, the cry did knock</p>
<p>Against my very heart! Poor souls, they perish’d!</p>
<p>Had I been any god of power, I would</p>
<p>Have sunk the sea within the earth, or ere</p>
<p>It should the good ship so have swallow’d and</p>
<p>The fraughting souls within her.</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em></p>
<p>Be collected:</p>
<p>No more amazement: tell your piteous heart</p>
<p>There’s no harm done.</p>
<p><em>Mir.</em>,</p>
<p>O, woe the day!</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em></p>
<p>No harm.</p>
<p>I have done nothing but in care of thee,</p>
<p>Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who</p>
<p>Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing</p>
<p>Of whence I am, nor that I am more better,</p>
<p>Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,</p>
<p>And thy no greater father.</p>
<p><em>Mir.</em></p>
<p>More to know</p>
<p>Did never meddle with my thoughts.</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em></p>

<p>I have with such provision in mine art</p>
<p>So safely order’d, that there is no soul,,</p>
<p>No, not so much perdition as an hair</p>
<p>Betid to any creature in the vessel</p>
<p>Which thou heard’st cry, which thou saw’st sink. Sit down;</p>
<p>For thou must now know farther.</p>
<p><em>Mir.</em></p>
<p>You have often</p>
<p>Begun to tell me what I am; but stopp’d,</p>
<p>And left me to a bootless inquisition,</p>
<p>Concluding “Stay: not yet.”</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em></p>
<p>The hour’s now come;</p>
<p>The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;</p>
<p>Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember</p>
<p>A time before we came unto this cell?</p>
<p>I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not</p>
<p>Out three years old.</p>
<p><em>Mir.</em></p>
<p>Certainly, sir, I can.</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em> By what? by any other house or person?</p>
<p>Of any thing the image tell me that</p>
<p>Hath kept with thy remembrance.</p>
<p><em>Mir.</em></p>
<p>’Tis far off,</p>
<p>And rather like a dream than an assurance</p>
<p>That my remembrance warrants. Had I not</p>
<p>Four or five women once that tended me?</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em> Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it</p>
<p>That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else</p>

<p>But that I do not.</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em> Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,</p>
<p>Thy father was the Duke of Milan, and</p>
<p>A prince of power.</p>
<p><em>Mir.</em></p>
<p>Sir, are not you my father?</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em> Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and</p>
<p>She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father</p>
<p>Was Duke of Milan; and his only heir,</p>
<p>And princess, no worse issued.</p>
<p><em>Mir.</em></p>
<p>O the heavens!</p>
<p>What foul play had we, that we came from thence?</p>
<p>Or blessed was’t we did?</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em></p>
<p>Both, both, my girl:</p>
<p>By foul play, as thou say’st, were we heaved thence;</p>
<p>But blessedly holp hither.</p>
<p><em>Mir.</em></p>

<p>To think o’ the teen that I have turn’d you to.</p>
<p>Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em> My brother, and thy uncle, call’d Antonio,—</p>
<p>I pray thee, mark me,—that a brother should</p>
<p>Be so perfidious!—he whom, next thyself,</p>
<p>Of all the world I loved, and to him put</p>
<p>The manage of my state; as, at that time,</p>
<p>Through all the signories it was the first,</p>
<p>And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed</p>
<p>In dignity, and for the liberal arts</p>
<p>Without a parallel; those being all my study,</p>

<p>And to my state grew stranger, being transported</p>
<p>And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle—</p>
<p>Dost thou attend me,?</p>
<p><em>Mir.</em></p>
<p>Sir, most heedfully.</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em> Being once perfected how to grant suits,</p>
<p>How to deny them, whom to advance, and whom,</p>
<p>To trash for over-topping, new created</p>
<p>The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed ’em,,</p>
<p>Or else new form’d ’em,; having both the key</p>
<p>Of officer and office, set all hearts i’ the state,</p>
<p>To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was</p>
<p>The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,</p>
<p>And suck’d my verdure out on’t. Thou attend’st not.</p>

<p>O’er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother</p>
<p>Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,</p>
<p>Like a good parent, did beget of him</p>
<p>A falsehood in its contrary, as great</p>
<p>As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,</p>
<p>A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,,</p>

<p>Made such a sinner of his memory,,</p>
<p>To credit his own lie, he did believe</p>
<p>He was indeed the duke,; out o’ the substitution,</p>
<p>And executing the outward face of royalty,</p>
<p>With all prerogative:—hence his ambition growing,,—</p>
<p>Dost thou hear,?</p>
<p><em>Mir.</em></p>
<p>Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em> To have no screen between this part he play’d</p>

<p>Absolute Milan,. Me, poor man, my library</p>
<p>Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties</p>
<p>He thinks me now incapable; confederates,</p>
<p>So dry he was for sway, wi’ the King of Naples</p>
<p>To give him annual tribute, do him homage,</p>
<p>Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend</p>
<p>The dukedom, yet unbow’d,—alas, poor Milan!—</p>
<p>To most ignoble stooping.</p>

<p>Now the condition.</p>
<p>This King of Naples, being an enemy</p>
<p>To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit;</p>
<p>Which was, that he, in lieu o’ the premises,</p>
<p>Of homage and I know not how much tribute,</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>125 Should presently extirpate me and mine</li>

<p>Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan,</p>
<p>With all the honours, on my brother: whereon,</p>
<p>A treacherous army levied, one midnight</p>
<p>Fated to the purpose,, did Antonio open</p>
<p>The gates of Milan; and, i’ the dead of darkness,</p>
<p>The ministers for the purpose hurried thence</p>
<p>Me and thy crying self.</p>
<p><em>Mir.</em></p>
<p>Alack, for pity!</p>
<p>I, not remembering how I cried out then,</p>
<p>Will cry it o’er again: it is a hint</p>
<p>That wrings mine eyes to’t,.</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em></p>
<p>Hear a little further,</p>

<p>Wherefore did they not</p>
<p>That hour destroy us?</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em></p>
<p>Well demanded, wench:</p>
<p>My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,</p>
<p>So dear the love my people bore me,; nor set</p>
<p>A mark so bloody on the business; but</p>
<p>With colours fairer painted their foul ends.</p>
<p>In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,</p>
<p>Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared</p>
<p>A rotten carcass of a boat,, not rigg’d,</p>
<p>Nor tackle, sail,, nor mast; the very rats</p>
<p>Instinctively have quit it: there they hoist us,</p>
<p>To cry to the sea that roar’d to us; to sigh</p>
<hr>

<p>Did us but loving wrong.</p>
<p><em>Mir.</em></p>
<p>Alack, what trouble</p>
<p>Was I then to you!</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em></p>
<p>O, a cherubin</p>
<p>Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,</p>
<p>Infused with a fortitude from heaven,</p>
<p>When I have deck’d the sea with drops full salt,</p>
<p>Under my burthen groan’d; which raised in me</p>
<p>An undergoing stomach, to bear up</p>
<p>Against what should ensue.</p>
<p><em>Mir.</em></p>
<p>How came we ashore?</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em> By Providence divine.</p>
<p>Some food we had, and some fresh water, that</p>
<p>A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,</p>
<p>Out of his charity, who being then appointed</p>
<p>Master of this design, did give us, with</p>
<p>Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,</p>
<p>Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,</p>
<p>Knowing I loved my books, he furnish’d me</p>
<p>From mine own library with volumes that</p>
<p>I prize above my dukedom.</p>
<p><em>Mir.</em></p>
<p>Would I might</p>
<p>But ever see that man!</p>

<p>Now I arise : [Resumes his mantle.,</p>
<p>Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.</p>
<p>Here in this island we arrived; and here</p>
<p>Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit</p>
<p>Than other princesses can, that have more time</p>
<p>For vainer hours, and tutors not so careful.</p>

<p>By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,</p>
<p>Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies</p>
<p>Brought to this shore; and by my prescience</p>
<p>I find my zenith doth depend upon</p>
<p>A most auspicious star, whose influence</p>
<p>If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes</p>
<p>Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:</p>
<p>Thou art inclined to sleep; ’tis a good dulness,</p>

<p>Then all afire with me: the king’s son,, Ferdinand,</p>

<p>The king’s son have I landed by himself;</p>
<p>Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs</p>

<p>And are  [upon the Mediterranean flote,</p>

<p><em>Seb.</em> Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.</p>
<p><em>Gon.</em> Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when 65 we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the king’s fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.</p>

<p><em>Trin.</em> Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They 5 say there’s but five upon this isle: we are three of them; if th’ other two be brained like us, the state totters.</p>
<p><em>Ste.</em> Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes are almost set in thy head,.</p>
<p><em>Trin.</em> Where should they be set else? he were a brave 10 monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.</p>
<p><em>Ste.</em> My man-monster hath drowned his tongue in sack: for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I could recover the shore, five-and-thirty leagues off and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my 15 standard.</p>
<p><em>Trin.</em> Your lieutenant, if you list; he’s no standard.</p>
<p><em>Ste.</em> We’ll not run, Monsieur Monster.</p>
<p><em>Trin.</em> Nor go neither; but you’ll lie, like dogs, and yet say nothing neither.</p>
<p><em>Ste.</em> Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a good moon-calf.</p>
<p><em>Cal.</em> How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe. I’ll not serve him, he is not valiant.</p>
<p><em>Trin.</em> Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case III. 2. 25 to justle a constable. Why, thou debauched fish, thou, was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a monster?</p>
<p><em>Cal.</em> Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?</p>
<p><em>Trin.</em> ‘Lord,’ quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!</p>
<p><em>Cal.</em> Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.</p>
<p><em>Ste.</em> Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you prove a mutineer,—the next tree! The poor monster’s my 35 subject, and he shall not suffer indignity.</p>
<p><em>Cal.</em> I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee,?</p>
<p><em>Ste.</em> Marry, will I: kneel and repeat it; I will stand, and so shall Trinculo.</p>

<p><em>Cal.</em> Thou shalt be lord of it, and I’ll serve thee.</p>
<p><em>Ste.</em> How now shall this be compassed? Canst thou bring me to the party?</p>
<p><em>Cal.</em> Yea, yea, my lord: I’ll yield him thee asleep,</p>
<p>Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.</p>
<p><em>Ari.</em> Thou liest; thou canst not.</p>
<p><em>Cal.</em> What a pied ninny’s this! Thou scurvy patch!,</p>
<p>I do beseech thy Greatness, give him blows,</p>
<p>And take his bottle from him: when that’s gone,</p>
<p>He shall drink nought but brine; for I’ll not show him</p>
<p>Where the quick freshes are.</p>
<p><em>Ste.</em> Trinculo, run into no further danger: interrupt the monster one word further, and, by this hand, I’ll turn my mercy out o’ doors, and make a stock-fish of thee.</p>
<p><em>Trin.</em> Why, what did I? I did nothing. I’ll go farther off.</p>
<p><em>Ste.</em> Didst thou not say he lied?</p>
<p><em>Ari.</em> Thou liest.</p>
<p><em>Ste.</em> Do I so? take thou that. [_Beats him._] As you like this, give me the lie another time.</p>
<p><em>Trin.</em> I did not give the lie. Out o’ your wits, and III. 2. 75 hearing too? A pox o’ your bottle! this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the devil take your fingers!</p>
<p><em>Cal.</em> Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p><em>Ste.</em> Now, forward with your tale.—Prithee, stand farther 80 off.</p>
<p><em>Cal.</em> Beat him enough: after a little time, I’ll beat him too.</p>
<p><em>Ste.</em> Stand farther. Come, proceed.</p>
<p><em>Cal.</em> Why, as I told thee, ’tis a custom with him</p>
<p>I’ th’ afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,</p>
<p>Having first seized his books; or with a log</p>
<p>Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,</p>
<p>Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember</p>
<p>First to possess his books; for without them</p>
<p>He’s but a sot, as I am, nor hath not</p>
<p>One spirit to command: they all do hate him</p>
<p>As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.</p>
<p>He has brave utensils,—for so he calls them,—</p>
<p>Which, when he has a house, he’ll deck withal.</p>
<p>And that most deeply to consider is</p>
<p>The beauty of his daughter; he himself</p>
<p>Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,,</p>
<p>But only Sycorax my dam and she;</p>
<p>But she as far surpasseth Sycorax</p>
<p>As great’st does least,.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I will be king and queen,—save our Graces!—and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou like the plot, 105 Trinculo?</p>
<p><em>Trin.</em> Excellent.</p>
<p><em>Ste.</em> Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but, while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.</p>
<p><em>Cal.</em> Within this half hour will he be asleep:</p>
<p>Wilt thou destroy him then?</p>
<p><em>Ste.</em></p>
<p>Ay, on mine honour.</p>
<p><em>Ari.</em> This will I tell my master.</p>
<p><em>Cal.</em> Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:</p>
<p>Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch</p>
<p>You taught me but while-ere?</p>
<p><em>Ste.</em>  At thy request, monster, I will do reason, [any reason. —Come on. Trinculo, let us sing. Sings.</p>
<p>Flout ’em and scout ’em, and scout ’em and flout ’em;</p>
<p>Thought is free.</p>
<p><em>Cal.</em> That’s not the tune.</p>
<p>Ariel plays the tune on a tabor and pipe.</p>
<p><em>Ste.</em> What is this same?</p>
<p><em>Trin.</em> This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture of Nobody.</p>

<p><em>Ste.</em> No, monster, not I.</p>
<p><em>Cal.</em> Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,</p>
<p>Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.</p>
<p>Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments</p>
<p>Will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices,</p>
<p>That, if I then had waked after long sleep,</p>
<p>Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,</p>
<p>The clouds methought would open, and show riches</p>
<p>Ready to drop upon me; that,, when I waked,</p>
<p>I cried to dream again.</p>
<p><em>Ste.</em> This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I 140 shall have my music for nothing.</p>
<p><em>Cal.</em> When Prospero is destroyed.</p>
<p><em>Ste.</em> That shall be by and by: I remember the story.</p>
<p><em>Trin.</em> The sound is going away; let’s follow it, and after do our work.</p>

<p>Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot</p>
<p>Be measured or confined.</p>
<p><em>Gon.</em></p>
<p>Whether this be</p>
<p>Or be not, I’ll not swear.</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em></p>
<p>You do yet taste</p>
<p>Some subtilties o’ the isle, that will not let you</p>

<li>125 Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!
[_Aside to Seb. and Ant._] But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,</li>

<p>I here could pluck his Highness’ frown upon you,</p>
<p>And justify you traitors: at this time</p>
<p>I will tell no tales.</p>
<p><em>Seb.</em> [_Aside_]</p>
<p>The devil speaks in him.</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother</p>
<p>Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive</p>
<p>Thy rankest fault,,—all of them; and require</p>
<p>My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,</p>
<p>Thou must restore.</p>
<p><em>Alon.</em></p>
<p>If thou be’st Prospero,</p>
<p>Give us particulars of thy preservation;</p>
<p>How thou hast met us here, who three hours since</p>
<p>Were wreck’d upon this shore; where I have lost—</p>
<p>How sharp the point of this remembrance is!—</p>
<p>My dear son Ferdinand.</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em></p>
<p>I am woe for’t, sir.</p>
<p><em>Alon.</em> Irreparable is the loss; and patience</p>
<p>Says it is past her cure.</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em></p>
<p>I rather think</p>
<p>You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace</p>
<p>For the like loss I have her sovereign aid,</p>
<p>And rest myself content.</p>
<p><em>Alon.</em></p>
<p>You the like loss!</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em> As great to me as late; and, supportable,</p>
<p>To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker</p>
<p>Than you may call to comfort you, for I</p>
<p>Have lost my daughter.</p>
<p><em>Alon.</em></p>
<p>A daughter,?</p>
<p>O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,</p>
<hr>
<h4>V.</h4>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>150 The king and queen there! that they were, I wish</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Myself were mudded in that oozy bed</p>
<p>Where my son lies. When did you lose you daughter?</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em> In this last tempest. I perceive, these lords</p>
<p>At this encounter do so much admire,</p>
<p>That they devour their reason, and scarce think</p>
<p>Their eyes  do offices of truth, [their words</p>
<p>Are natural breath: but, howsoe’er you have</p>
<p>Been justled from your senses, know for certain</p>
<p>That I am Prospero, and that very duke</p>
<p>Which was thrust forth of Milan; who most strangely</p>
<p>Upon this shore, where you were wreck’d, was landed,</p>
<p>To be the Lord on’t. No more yet of this;</p>
<p>For ’tis a chronicle of day by day,</p>
<p>Not a relation for a breakfast, nor</p>
<p>Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;</p>
<p>This cell’s my court: here have I few attendants,</p>
<p>And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.</p>
<p>My dukedom since you have given me again,</p>
<p>I will requite you with as good a thing;</p>
<p>At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye</p>
<p>As much as me my dukedom.</p>
<h5>Here Prospero discovers Ferdinand and Miranda playing at chess.,</h5>
<p><em>Mir.</em> Sweet lord, you play me false.</p>
<p><em>Fer.</em></p>
<p>No, my dear’st love,</p>
<p>I would not for the world.</p>
<p><em>Mir.</em> Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,</p>
<p>And I would call it fair play.</p>

<p>O, wonder!</p>
<p>How many goodly creatures are there here!</p>
<p>How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,</p>
<p>That has such people in’t!</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em></p>
<p>’Tis new to thee.</p>
<p><em>Alon.</em> What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?</p>
<p>Your eld’st acquaintance cannot be three hours:</p>
<p>Is she the goddess that hath sever’d us,</p>
<p>And brought us thus together?</p>
<p><em>Fer.</em></p>
<p>Sir, she is mortal;</p>
<p>But by immortal Providence she’s mine:</p>
<p>I chose her when I could not ask my father</p>
<p>For his advice,, nor thought I had one. She</p>
<p>Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,</p>
<p>Of whom so often I have heard renown,</p>
<p>But never saw before; of whom I have</p>
<p>Received a second life; and second father</p>
<p>This lady makes him to me.</p>
<p><em>Alon.</em></p>
<p>I am hers:</p>
<p>But, O, how oddly will it sound that I</p>
<p>Must ask my child forgiveness!</p>
<p><em>Pros.</em></p>
<p>There, sir, stop:</p>
<p>Let us not burthen our remembrances with,</p>
<p>A heaviness that’s gone.</p>

<p>For it is you that have chalk’d forth the way</p>
<p>Which brought us hither.</p>
<p><em>Alon.</em></p>
<p>I say, Amen, Gonzalo!</p>
<p><em>Gon.</em> Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue</p>
<p>Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice</p>
<p>Beyond a common joy! and set it down</p>
<p>With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage</p>
<p>Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,</p>
<p>And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife</p>
<p>Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom</p>
<p>In a poor isle, and all of us ourselves</p>
<p>When no man was his own.</p>
<p><em>Alon.</em> [_to Fer. and Mir._]</p>
<p>Give me your hands:</p>
<p>Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart</p>
<p>That doth not wish you joy!</p>

<p>Be it so! Amen!</p>

<h3>EPILOGUE.</h3>
<h5>SPOKEN BY PROSPERO.</h5>
<p>Now my charms are all o’erthrown,</p>
<p>And what strength I have’s mine own,</p>
<p>Which is most faint: now,, ’tis true,</p>
<p>I must be here confined by you,</p>
<p>Or sent to Naples. Let me not,</p>
<p>Since I have my dukedom got,</p>
<p>And pardon’d the deceiver, dwell</p>
<p>In this bare island by your spell;</p>
<p>But release me from my bands</p>
<p>With the help of your good hands:</p>
<p>Gentle breath of yours my sails</p>
<p>Must fill, or else my project fails,</p>
<p>Which was to please. Now I want</p>
<p>Spirits to enforce, art to enchant;</p>
<p>And my ending is despair,</p>
<p>Unless I be relieved by prayer,</p>
<p>Which pierces so, that it assaults</p>
<p>Mercy itself, and frees all faults.</p>
<p>As you from crimes would pardon’d be,</p>
<p>Let your indulgence set me free.</p>
