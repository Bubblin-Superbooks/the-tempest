<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p><em>Ste.</em> This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil should he learn our language? I will give him some relief, if it be 65 but for that. If I can recover him, and keep him tame, and get to Naples with him, he’s a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat’s-leather.</p><p><em>Cal.</em> Do not torment me, prithee; I’ll bring my wood home faster.</p><p><em>Ste.</em> He’s in his fit now, and does not talk after the wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have never drunk wine afore, it will go near to remove his fit. If I can recover him, and keep him tame, I will not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that hath him, and that soundly.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
