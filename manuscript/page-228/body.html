Let me not,</p><p>Since I have my dukedom got,</p><p>And pardon’d the deceiver, dwell</p><p>In this bare island by your spell;</p><p>But release me from my bands</p><p>With the help of your good hands:</p><p>Gentle breath of yours my sails</p><p>Must fill, or else my project fails,</p><p>Which was to please. Now I want</p><p>Spirits to enforce, art to enchant;</p><p>And my ending is despair,</p></div> </div>
