We are such stuff</p><p>As dreams are made on; and our little life</p><p>Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex’d;</p><p>Bear with my weakness; my old brain is troubled:</p><p>Be not disturb’d with my infirmity:</p><p>If you be pleased, retire into my cell,</p><p>And there repose: a turn or two I’ll walk,</p><p>To still my beating mind.</p></div> </div>
